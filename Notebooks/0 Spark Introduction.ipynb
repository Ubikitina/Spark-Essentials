This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is forever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>perpetual splendour.  There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>solitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library.  My education was neglected,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.  And now, dear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>every enticement that wealth placed in my path.  Oh, that some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>depressed.  I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude:  I am required not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whale-fishing.  I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Your affectionate brother,</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>  R. Walton</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Archangel, 28th March, 17—</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>am self-educated:  for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages. At</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>native country.  Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.  It is true that I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these rugged bosoms.  My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his profession.  He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.  The master is a person</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.  This circumstance,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desirous to engage him.  A youth passed in solitude, my best years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.  This, briefly, is his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father of the girl consented to the match.  He saw his mistress once</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to her inclinations.  \"What a noble fellow!\" you will exclaim.  He is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so; but then he is wholly uneducated:  he is as silent as a Turk, and a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which otherwise he would command.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to \"the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>production of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at work in my soul which I do not understand.  I am practically</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>picture.  Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly.  Remember me with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affection, should you never hear from me again.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>see my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am, however, in good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Adieu, my dear Margaret.  Be assured that for my own sake, as well as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But success SHALL crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.  Why not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>determined heart and resolved will of man?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>finish.  Heaven bless my beloved sister!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>August 5th, 17—</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reality, so distant as we had supposed.  Shut in, however, by ice, it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.  We,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ice.  I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some undiscovered island, but a European.

His limbs were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.

For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so attractive and amiable.

Do you share my madness?  Have you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>converse concerning myself personally.  He asked me the history of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.  \"I agree with you,\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>world before you, and have no cause for despair.

My ancestors had been for many years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>situations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>months before my father discovered his abode.  Overjoyed at this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>him.  Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of any exertion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>support life.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Several months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her an orphan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>chamber.

Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and her convenience.

I remained, while the storm lasted, watching</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tree shattered in a singular manner.  It was not splintered by the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.  I never beheld</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>electricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despicable.

I, who had ever been surrounded by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mutual pleasure—I was now alone.  In the university whither I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were \"old familiar faces,\" but I believed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>station among other human beings.

At length the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>visit to some of the principal professors.  Chance—or rather the evil</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nonsense?\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.  This professor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was very unlike his colleague.  He appeared about fifty years of age,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the sweetest I had ever heard.  He began his lecture by a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the most distinguished discoverers.  He then took a cursory view of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terms.  After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>never forget:  \"The ancient teachers of this science,\" said he,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  The modern masters</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.  They have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its own shadows.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Such were the professor's words—rather let me say such the words of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>one purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning's dawn,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>given to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M.

They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.\"  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I am happy,\" said M. Waldman, \"to have gained a disciple; and if your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>neglected the other branches of science.

He also gave me the list of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>university.  When I had arrived at this point and had become as well</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happened that protracted my stay.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>life.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>food for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>charnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.  I paused, examining and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.  The sun does not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>true.  Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>animation upon lifeless matter.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soon gave place to delight and rapture.  After so much time spent in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the world was now within my grasp.  Not that, like a magic scene, it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>difficulty and labour.  I doubted at first whether I should attempt the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>argument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>began the creation of a human being.  As the minuteness of the parts</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who shall conceive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>frame.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brought my work near to a conclusion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>well remembered the words of my father:  \"I know that while you are</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.  I wished, as it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.  My father made no reproach</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.  But my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.  Every night I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.  For this I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deprived myself of rest and health.

I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>created.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>such as even Dante could not have conceived.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I passed the night wretchedly.  Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.  Mingled with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>view.  I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from a black and comfortless sky.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth walk in fear and dread,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  And, having once turned round, walks on,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  And turns no more his head;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  Because he knows a frightful fiend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth close behind him tread.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>various diligences and carriages usually stopped.  Here I paused, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so dear to my recollection.  I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>during many months, calm and serene joy.  I welcomed my friend,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>college.  Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ingolstadt.  \"You may easily believe,\" said he, \"how great was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Vicar of Wakefield:  'I have ten thousand florins a year without</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>end and that I am at length free.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.

Doubtless my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grieved my friend, I recovered.

I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Dearest Clerval,\" exclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are to me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you?

Madame Moritz,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>after the death of M.

My aunt observed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thing as a servant in France and England.

My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very ill; but other</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>trials were reserved for her.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>repentant mother.

She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brothers and sister.

I could not doubt it.  The mere presence of the idea was an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the summit, and disappeared.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was this his first crime?  Alas!

The gates were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>open, and I hastened to my father's house.  My first thought was to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.

Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>overhanging sides of Mont Saleve?

While</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"The murderer discovered!

During this interval, one of the servants,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earnestly, \"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.

Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>poor William.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father, \"for indeed I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced in my own mind that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brought forward strong enough to convict her.

I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>upon my own.  Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>never shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am sure she will not;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I, \"and that shall be proved;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquittal.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hopeless and despairing.\"  She wept.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Dearest niece,\" said my father, \"dry your tears.

My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her own judgment and feelings to decide.  \"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could not refuse.  We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>manacled, and her head rested on her knees.  She rose on seeing us</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.  My cousin wept also.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Oh, Justine!\" said she.  \"Why did you rob me of my last consolation?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was not so miserable as I am now.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?

But that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could not be.  Remorse extinguished every hope.

The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>displayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>overhangs it.

The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>more ruined castles and fertile fields.

Then I spurred on my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the giver of oblivion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.

I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mighty friends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Montanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>solitary grandeur of the scene.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>received from the objects around me.

For myself, there was one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forget the past in my union with her.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>machinations.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country.  My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the appearances of the sky.  \"This is what it is to live,\" he cried;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"how I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you desponding and sorrowful!\" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enjoyment.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>presents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>labourers as we glided down the stream.  Even I, depressed in mind, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stranger.  And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a happiness seldom tasted by man.  \"I have seen,\" he said, \"the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that believe the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.  The mountains</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.  Look</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>village half hid in the recess of the mountain.  Oh, surely the spirit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the mountains of our own country.\" Clerval!  Beloved friend!  Even now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you are so eminently deserving.  He was a being formed in the \"very</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>poetry of nature.\" His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>admiration, he loved with ardour:—</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>     ——The sounding cataract</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>     Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>     By thought supplied, or any interest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>                    [Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\".]</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>And where does he now exist?

I will</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.  It was on a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>white cliffs of Britain.  The banks of the Thames presented a new</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the remembrance of some story.  We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>above all, and the Tower famed in English history.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>months in this wonderful and celebrated city.  Clerval desired the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distinguished natural philosophers.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was so terribly profound.  Company was irksome to me; when alone, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>peace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my soul with anguish.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and anxious to gain experience and instruction.  The difference of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.  I tried to conceal this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on the head.  Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as Perth, where he resided.  Clerval eagerly desired to accept this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beginning of October, and it was now February.  We accordingly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of another month.  In this expedition we did not intend to follow the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>about the end of July.  I packed up my chemical instruments and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stately deer were all novelties to us.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>From thence we proceeded to Oxford.  As we entered this city our minds</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>elasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>themselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>miserable self.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>place of rest.  The country in the neighbourhood of this village</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inferiors.  \"I could pass my life here,\" said he to me; \"and among</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>read and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alone.  \"Do you,\" said I, \"enjoy yourself, and let this be our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rendezvous.

I did not doubt but that the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.  It was a place fitted for such</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beaten upon by the waves.  The soil was barren, scarcely affording</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tokens of their miserable fare.

During my first experiment, a kind of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dreaded to behold.  I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in my bosom.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unremitting attention to it.  As I sat, a train of reflection occurred</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it when it came before his eyes in the female form?  She also might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>precarious and full of terror.  Had I right, for my own benefit, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the whole human race.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the light of the moon the daemon at the casement.  A ghastly grin</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which he had allotted to me.  Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fulfilment of my promise.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.  The wretch saw me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.  A few fishing vessels alone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of voices as the fishermen called to one another.  I felt the silence,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>endeavoured to open it softly.

Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the impotence of anger.  \"Shall each man,\" cried he, \"find a wife for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happiness forever.  Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my wretchedness?  You can blast my other passions, but revenge</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!  I may die, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"It is well.

I burned with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.  Why</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?  But I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mainland.  I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.  The prospect did not move</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>without a bitter struggle.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sinks into the depths of despair.  I left the house, the horrid scene</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>across me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>join him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Indian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my society on him as I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>southwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.  Yet,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the door of my laboratory.  The remains of the half-finished creature,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>collect myself and then entered the chamber.  With trembling hand I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon.  I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conclusion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>towards land, but I sailed away from them.  I felt as if I was about</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from the spot.  The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.  But it refreshed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time I slept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>considerably.  The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the safety of my little skiff.  I found that the wind was northeast and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.  Thus</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me.  I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.  I looked on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>free from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have of life even in the excess of misery!  I constructed another sail</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nourishment.  Fortunately I had money with me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>escape.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  \"My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>good friends,\" said I, \"will you be so kind as to tell me the name of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>roughly?\"  I replied.  \"Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>receive strangers so inhospitably.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.  Their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed  and in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some degree alarmed me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Who is Mr. Kirwin?

Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.  I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>proper detail, to my recollection.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 21</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>benevolent man with calm and mild manners.

She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Are you better now, sir?\" said she.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \"I believe I am;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.

We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could continue my journey.  My father's care and attentions were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.

A few days before we left Paris on our way to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"My dear Friend,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must have suffered!  I expect to see you looking even more ill than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>comfort and tranquillity.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.

Such would be my liberty except that in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!

But to me the remembrance of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT,\" I should regard the threatened fate as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hastened that of a far dearer victim.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.

Preparations were made for the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tragedy.  Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fiend should openly attack me.

The day was fair, the wind favourable;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I took the hand of Elizabeth.  \"You are sorrowful, my love.

The murderous mark of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from her lips.  While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happened to look up.  The windows of the room had before been darkened,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>illuminate the chamber.  The shutters had been thrown back, and with a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>towards the corpse of my wife.  I rushed towards the window, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>boats; nets were cast, but in vain.

After having landed, they proceeded to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.

However, it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.

But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this last overwhelming event?  Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>words, what remains of my hideous narration. I arrived at Geneva.  My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doomed him to waste in wretchedness!

I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have to make.  It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wonderful, forces conviction.  The story is too connected to be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\" My manner as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.  I now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disbelief, was painted on his countenance.  When I had concluded my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>narration I said, \"This is the being whom I accuse and for whose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>physiognomy of my own auditor.  He had heard my story with that half</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mildly, \"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all my exertions to defiance.  Who can follow an animal which can</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>venture to intrude?  Besides, some months have elapsed since the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and destroyed as a beast of prey.  But I perceive your thoughts; you do</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>punishment which is his desert.\" As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Man,\" I cried, \"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!  Cease;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you know not what it is you say.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some other mode of action.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 24</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>swallowed up and lost.  I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>delirium or death would have been my portion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hateful.  I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.  And now my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wanderings began which are to cease but with life.  I have traversed a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.  But revenge kept me alive;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.  But my plan was unsettled,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>what path I should pursue.  As night approached I found myself at the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>graves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to rage and despair.  They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.  I knelt</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>aid and conduct me in my work.  Let the cursed and hellish monster</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>laugh.  It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was reserved for vengeance.  The laughter died away, when a well-known</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>audible whisper, \"I am satisfied, miserable wretch!  You have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>left some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>few drops that revived me, and vanish.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pilgrimage.  Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hardships.  During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.  What agonizing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soul.  What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.  Sometimes,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.  Come on, my enemy; we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Scoffing devil!  Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>chief article of maintenance.  The triumph of my enemy increased with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>south!  Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to meet and grapple with him.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hideous death.  In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me hopes of succour and life.  I had no conception that vessels ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ship.  I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unfulfilled.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Oh!  When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?  If I do,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and fiend-like malice.  Hear him not; call on the names of William,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>                                                August 26th, 17—</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mine?  Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and admiration.  Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>impenetrable. \"Are you mad, my friend?\" said he.  \"Or whither does your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>senseless curiosity lead you?  Would you also create for yourself and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not seek to increase your own.\"  Frankenstein discovered that I made</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. \"Since</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you have preserved my narration,\" said he, \"I would not that a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mutilated one should go down to posterity.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tale that ever imagination formed.  My thoughts and every feeling of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>every hope of consolation, to live?  Oh, no!  The only joy that he can</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>death.  Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remote world.  This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>misfortunes.  On every point of general literature he displays</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enterprise.  My feelings are profound, but I possessed a  coolness of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>herd of common projectors.  But this thought, which supported me in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>executed the creation of a man.  Even now I cannot recollect without</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ambition; but how am I sunk!  Oh!  My friend, if you had known me as I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>admirable being?  I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>would sympathize with and love me.  Behold, on these desert seas I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and lose him.  I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I thank you, Walton,\" he said, \"for your kind intentions towards so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?  Even</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>contemplated with suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not only</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>threaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The brave fellows whom I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>through me.  If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?  You will not hear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.  Years will</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bless you and make you so!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.  He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.  Even the sailors feel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>resolutions of man.  These feelings are transitory; each day of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>caused by this despair.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September 5th</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desolation.  Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lifelessness.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.  They</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entered, and their leader addressed me.  He told me that he and his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this.  They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>course southwards.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This speech troubled me.  I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the idea of returning if set free.  Yet could I, in justice, or even in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you, then, so easily turned from your design?  Did you not call this a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>glorious expedition?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it, and these you were to brave and overcome.  For this was it a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.  You were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>yourselves cowards.  Oh!  Be men, or be more than men.  Be steady to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that it shall not.  Do not return to your families with the stigma of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?  They looked at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with reflection, their courage would return.  They retired and I turned</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>life.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.  Yet I fear such will be my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September 7th</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ignorant and disappointed.  It requires more philosophy than I possess</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September 12th</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and glory; I have lost my friend.  But I will endeavour to detail these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to his bed.  The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passage towards the south became perfectly free.  When the sailors saw</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Do you, then, really return?\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not.  I am weak, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sufficient strength.\"  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entirely extinct.  At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>come near, said, \"Alas!  The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conduct; nor do I find it blamable.  In a fit of enthusiastic madness I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>create a companion for the first creature.  He showed unparalleled</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>little chance of meeting with him.  But the consideration of these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>approach of death.  I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>may still be misled by passion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>science and discoveries.  Yet why do I say this?  I have myself been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>effort, he sank into silence.  About half an hour afterwards he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>glorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disappointment.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>consolation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Good night, my sister.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Great God! what a scene has just taken place!  I am yet dizzy with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.  Over him hung a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>uncouth and distorted in its proportions.  As he hung over the coffin,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grief and horror and sprung towards the window.  Never did I behold a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hideousness.  I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.  I called on him to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"That is also my victim!\" he exclaimed.  \"In his murder my crimes are</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that I now ask thee to pardon me?  I, who irretrievably destroyed thee</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in his ugliness.  I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lips.  The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pause of the tempest of his passion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Your repentance,\" I said, \"is now superfluous. If you had listened to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>yet have lived.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"And do you dream?\" said the daemon.  \"Do you think that I was then</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hurried me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.  Think you that the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>groans of Clerval were music to my ears?  My heart was fashioned to be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and overcome.

I also</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.

I desire the company of a man</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>friend.  I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>own, to approve or amend my plans.  How would such a friend repair the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>faults of your poor brother!  I am too ardent in execution and too</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>impatient of difficulties.

I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>story.  Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>would never consent to the union.  My generous friend reassured the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>abandoned his pursuit.  He had already bought a farm with his money, on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover.  But the old</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>safety of others is committed to my care.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>undertaking.

I have often attributed my attachment to, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?

Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unqualified wonder.  We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>greatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>master said, \"Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>northern pole.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in so strange a vehicle.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he replied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, \"I have,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>benevolently restored me to life.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>should I have any fresh incidents to record.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>watching for the sledge that preceded his own.  Yet, although unhappy,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>himself deeply in the projects of others.  He has frequently conversed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.  He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>secure it.  I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>furtherance of my enterprise.  One man's life or death were but a small</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>our race.  As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>countenance.  At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>groan burst from his heaving breast.  I paused; at length he spoke, in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>drunk also of the intoxicating draught?  Hear me; let me reveal my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>necessary to restore his composure.  Having conquered the violence of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earlier years.  The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>trains of reflection.  I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>replied the stranger; \"we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>therefore, to judge respecting friendship.  You have hope, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>everything and cannot begin life anew.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grief that touched me to the heart.  But he was silent and presently</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wanderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>August 19, 17—</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive, Captain</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these feelings in my answer.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I thank you,\" he replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is useless; my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but for one event, and then I shall</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>repose in peace.  I understand your feeling,\" continued he, perceiving</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>determined.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I should be at leisure.  This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>notes.  This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>business.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>husband and the father of a family.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the world again through his credit and assistance.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>near the Reuss.  But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>employment in a merchant's house.  The interval was, consequently, spent</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>there was no other prospect of support.  But Caroline Beaufort</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her in her adversity.  She procured plain work; she plaited straw and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affection.  There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>strongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to his behaviour to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wishes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>benevolent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as a restorative for her weakened frame.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remained for several years their only child.  Much as they were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>regarding me are my first recollections.  I was their plaything and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Como.  Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the poor.  This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its worst shape.  One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.  She found a peasant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attracted my mother far above all the rest.  She appeared of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>different stock.

She</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was a German and had died on giving her birth.  The infant had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.  He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>became the victim of its weakness.  Whether he had died or still</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.  His property was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.  She continued</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.  When my father returned from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.  They consulted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone loved Elizabeth.

On the evening previous to her being brought to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my home, my mother had said playfully, \"I have a pretty present for my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.

I need not say that we were strangers to any species of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>causes.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earliest sensations I can remember.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country.  We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>league from the city.  We resided principally in the latter, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.  I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.  Henry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.  He was a boy of singular</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knightly adventure.  He tried to make us act plays and to enter into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the infidels.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.  My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the development of filial love.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>day confined to the inn.  In this house I chanced to find a volume of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the works of Cornelius Agrippa.  I opened it with apathy; the theory</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.  A new light seemed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>greater ardour to my former studies.  It is even possible that the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.  I read and studied the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knew more.  I took their word for all that they averred, and I became</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>regard to my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thirst for knowledge.  Under the guidance of my new preceptors I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>obtained my undivided attention.  Wealth was an inferior object, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>current of my ideas.  When I was about fifteen years old we had retired</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its progress with curiosity and delight.  As I stood at the door, on a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but a blasted stump.  When we visited it the next morning, we found the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>anything so utterly destroyed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>be known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>real knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terrible destruction.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>worst event.  On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were placed on the prospect of your union.  This expectation will now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>be the consolation of your father.  Elizabeth, my love, you must supply</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>can be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Yet from whom has</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?  The time at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead, but we had still</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spoiler has not seized.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was now again determined upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>some weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her uncle and cousins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>evening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>aspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.  My life had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>invincible repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and hopes rose.  I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>high white steeple of the town met my eyes.  I alighted and was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.  The professor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stared.  \"Have you,\" he said, \"really spent your time in studying such</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I replied in the affirmative.  \"Every minute,\" continued M. Krempe with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>warmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>omitted.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>favour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was very different when the masters of the science sought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nearly black.  His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.  They penetrate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hiding-places.  They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the fate—enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>exhibited. He said that \"These were men to whose indefatigable zeal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>labours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>procure.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alone.  If your wish is to become really a man of science and not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.\"  He then took me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books which I had requested, and I took my leave.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>natural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I became</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>secret.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>discovery were distinct and probable.  After days and nights of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this discovery was so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ineffectual light.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>subject.  I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to your destruction and infallible misery.  Learn from me, if not by my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>will allow.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as man.  The materials at present within my command hardly appeared</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ultimately succeed.  I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>child so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with unremitting ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with study, and my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>person had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on the very</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>next day or the next hour might realize.  One secret which I alone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>one pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are equally neglected.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>should be completed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mind.  If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occupations more particularly than before.  Winter, spring, and summer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.  The leaves of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.  Sometimes I grew alarmed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alone sustained me:  my labours would soon end, and I believed that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of human nature.  I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.  At length lassitude</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the streets of Ingolstadt.  Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had so miserably given life.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Oh!  No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.  A mummy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.  The porter opened the gates</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>what I was doing.

I threw the door forcibly open, as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but I was unable to contain myself.

Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>them.  I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I contemplated the lake:  the waters were placid; all around was calm;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and the snowy mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed.

I discovered more distinctly the black</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.  I wept like a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>child.  \"Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lake!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>felt still more gloomily.  The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destined to endure.  It was completely dark when I arrived in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>murdered.  As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.  During this short voyage</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>over my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Copet.  Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>east of the lake.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with a hasty step.  This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear angel! this is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thy funeral, this thy dirge!\" As I said these words, I perceived in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stood fixed, gazing intently:  I could not be mistaken.  A flash of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the filthy daemon, to whom I had given life.  What did he there?  Could</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?  No</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>for support.  The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.  HE was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>irresistible proof of the fact.

I considered the being whom I had cast</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to destroy all that was dear to me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to attend their usual hour of rising.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.

Below this picture was a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was thus engaged, Ernest entered:  he had heard me arrive, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hastened to welcome me:  \"Welcome, my dearest Victor,\" said he.  \"Ah! I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all joyous and delighted.  You come to us now to share a misery which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"requires consolation; she accused</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>very wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered—\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  Indeed, who would credit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leaves no hope for doubt.

I saw unhappiness deeply impressed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.

Time had altered her since I last</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her childish years.  There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>She welcomed me with the greatest affection.  \"Your arrival, my dear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>William.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>commence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>seated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>charge, several witnesses were called.  Several strange facts combined</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>murdered child had been afterwards found.  The woman asked her what she</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>if anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, she</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine was called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded, her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>although variable voice.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>doubtful or suspicious.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Geneva.  On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Concerning the picture she could give no account.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I know,\" continued the unhappy victim, \"how heavily and fatally this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>placed in my pocket.  But here also I am checked.  I believe that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hope.  I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>innocence.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the court.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I am,\" said she, \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>parents ever since and even long before his birth.  It may therefore be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>know of her character.  I am well acquainted with the accused.  I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.  She nursed Madame</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.  For my own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in her innocence; I knew it.  Could the demon who had (I did not for a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?  I could not sustain the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the court; my lips and throat were parched.  I dared not ask the fatal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>visit.  The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was condemned.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world would</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>believe in human goodness?  Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cannot go alone.\"  The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?\" Her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>declared your guilt.  That report, you say, is false; and be assured,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I confessed, that I might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all my other sins.  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>She paused, weeping, and then continued, \"I thought with horror, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dear William! dearest blessed child!  I soon shall see you again in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>am to suffer ignominy and death.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Why did you confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl.  Do not fear.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt the stony</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.  You shall not die!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No!  No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine shook her head mournfully.  \"I do not fear to die,\" she said;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Who dared talk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.  Justine started.  When</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>she saw who it was, she approached me and said, \"Dear sir, you are very</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I could not answer.  \"No, Justine,\" said Elizabeth; \"he is more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>consolation.  Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cannot live in this world of misery.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>And on the morrow Justine died.  Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>criminality of the saintly sufferer.  My passionate and indignant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>avowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.  This also was my doing!  And my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are not your last tears!  Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and fear.  Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.  The blood flowed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heart which nothing could remove.  Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>behind.  Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brother\"—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—\"but is it not a duty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>man is fit for society.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>other sensations.  Now I could only answer my father with a look of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>particularly agreeable to me.  The shutting of the gates regularly at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>water.  Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might close over me and my calamities forever.  But I was restrained,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.  I thought also of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.  I had an obscure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>anything I loved remained behind.  My abhorrence of this fiend cannot</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thoughtlessly bestowed.  When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.  I would have made a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>precipitated him to their base.  I wished to see him again, that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deaths of William and Justine.  Our house was the house of mourning. My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.  The first</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appeared to me.  Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood.  Yet I am</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.  For the sake</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it had been her own!  I could not consent to the death of any human</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Alas!  Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>assure themselves of certain happiness?  I feel as if I were walking on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and perhaps respected.  But even if I were condemned to suffer on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wretch.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.  I, not in deed,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but in effect, was the true murderer.  Elizabeth read my anguish in my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My dearest friend, you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must calm yourself.  These events have affected me, God knows how</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.  There is an expression of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.  Have we lost</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the power of rendering you happy?  Ah!  While we love, while we are</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heart?  Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ineffectual.  I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sensations.  It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>towards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>boyhood.  Six years had passed since then:  _I_ was a wreck, but nought</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>injury on these rugged roads.  The weather was fine; it was about the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the ravine of Arve.  The immense mountains and precipices that overhung</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.  But it was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earth, the habitations of another race of beings.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I spent the following day roaming through the valley.  I stood beside</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>barricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gathered round me and bade me be at peace.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thought.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in their cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>other trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>   The path of its departure still is free.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>  Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>   Nought may endure but mutability!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>away from the joys of life.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mortal combat.  He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Devil,\" I exclaimed, \"do you dare approach me?  And do not you fear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?  Begone,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>oh!  That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I expected this reception,\" said the daemon.  \"All men hate the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>living things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>one of us.  You purpose to kill me.  How dare you sport thus with life?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mankind.  If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>so negligently bestowed.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He easily eluded me and said,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>increase my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>opposition to thee.  I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>alone am irrevocably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in which one must fall.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"How can I move thee?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>compassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>only one which man does not grudge.  These bleak skies I hail, for they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are kinder to me than your fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>no terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and they shall share my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.  Let your compassion be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>moved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when you have heard</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But hear me.  The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, praise the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Why do you call to my remembrance,\" I rejoined, \"circumstances of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>light!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from you.

I had heard of some discoveries</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>refuge in the most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But the fresh air and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>calling me aside, thus addressed me,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.

I expressed a wish to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>comply.  After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>return, have restored me entirely to myself.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.

Our journey here lost</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heard of even in my country.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 19</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>instruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had in view.  His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>European colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>execution of his plan.  He was forever busy, and the only check to his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>any care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to accompany him,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.  He mentioned</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>adorns her chosen dwelling-places.  We had arrived in England at the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>there more than a century and a half before.  It was here that Charles</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I. had collected his forces.  This city had remained faithful to him,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Parliament and liberty.  The memory of that unfortunate king and his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>domes, embosomed among aged trees.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>for peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>animating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>field on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>native country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Swiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>amidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are forever on the stretch; and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have interested the most unfortunate being.  Clerval did not like it so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to him.  But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>remonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  \"I had rather be with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>finished, that he might receive his companion.  With this resolution I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>penury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>door was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>benumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of men.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>monotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>plains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>irksome to me.  Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grew restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>persecutor.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>advanced.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 20</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>forever with the bitterest remorse.  I was now about to form another</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sake, in murder and wretchedness.  He had sworn to quit the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of being deserted by one of his own species.  Even if they were to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?  I had before been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>malice and treachery.  I thought with a sensation of madness on my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>terrible reveries.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>person landed close to my house.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the spot. Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, \"You</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.

Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.  I will</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beneath words.

Before you sign my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>precipitation.  In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waves.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ocean.  I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to his insatiate revenge.

In that hour I should die and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.  If I returned,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>loved and miserable in the separation.  When it became noon, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sleep.  I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.  I paused to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shore.  The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>any encounter with my fellow creatures.  At one time the moon, which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.

I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.  I confess</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that I felt a few sensations of terror.  I had no compass with me and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>world that the sun was of little benefit to me.  I might be driven into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Fiend,\" I exclaimed, \"your task is already fulfilled!\"  I thought of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.  This idea</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to reflect on it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>land towards the south.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>perceived the traces of cultivation.

I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this town and inform me where I am?\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"You will know that soon enough,\" replied a man with a hoarse voice.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>angry countenances of his companions.  \"Why do you answer me so</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I do not know,\" said the man, \"what the custom of the English may be,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.\" While this strange</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.  I then moved</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shoulder and said, \"Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>give an account of yourself.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>found murdered here last night.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>or death. I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>o'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accordingly put in for port.  It was a very dark night, as the moon had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.  He walked on first,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>at some distance.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>something and fell at his length on the ground.

They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>age.  He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>support.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>an unfavourable augury from my manner.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the same boat in which I had just landed.  A woman deposed that she</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.  This idea</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the mode of the murder had been described.  I was accordingly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and was led up to the coffin.  How can I describe my sensations on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.  The examination,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>exclaimed, \"Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dearest Henry, of life?  Two I have already destroyed; other victims</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to this.  I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>William, of Justine, and of Clerval.  Sometimes I entreated my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>other witnesses.  Why did I not die?  More miserable than man ever was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?  Death snatches</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tomb!  Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>torture?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>still alive to feel this misery and horror.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"For that matter,\" replied the old woman, \"if you mean about the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that's none</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hangman who would gain his fee?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wretchedness.  At one time I considered whether I should not declare</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in French, \"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.

The first sight that was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to say, \"Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father.

He could not help</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rather a severe tone, \"I should have thought, young man, that the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"My father!\" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>very kind!

He rose and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you, then, safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?\" My father calmed me with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>father,\" replied I; \"some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>coffin of Henry.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>could ensure tranquillity.

Then the appearance of death was distant, although the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>town where the court was held.

He talked</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these words only drew deep groans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despair.  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.  My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the waves.  I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>see Geneva.

I was unable to pursue the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soon slept profoundly.  But sleep did not afford me respite from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me.  Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>cries rang in my ears.  My father, who was watching over me, perceiving</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>seek amusement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>abhorred!  They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to share their intercourse.  I had unchained an enemy among them whose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>various arguments to banish my despair.

Elizabeth observed my agitation for</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>scream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>earth?  She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.  Could</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I behold this and live?  Alas!  Life is obstinate and clings closest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where it is most hated.  For a moment only did I lose recollection; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fell senseless on the ground.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.  She</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>figure the most hideous and abhorred.  A grin was on the face of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the lake.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>search the country, parties going in different directions among the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>woods and vines.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had lost.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>where the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me incapable of any exertion.  I threw down the oar, and leaning my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>by Elizabeth.  Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sudden change.  The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.  A fiend had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>you.  Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>desolate.  My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bore.  I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!  His eyes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>revenge on his cursed head.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>authority for the apprehension of the murderer.  The magistrate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>listened to me with attention and kindness.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Be assured, sir,\" said he, \"no pains or exertions on my part shall be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>spared to discover the villain.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I thank you,\" replied I; \"listen, therefore, to the deposition that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.  It</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>occasion.\"  This address caused a considerable change in the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the whole tide of his incredulity returned.  He, however, answered</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the magistrate was intimidated.  \"You are mistaken,\" said he.  \"I will</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.  But I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>loose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his destruction.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.  But to a Genevan</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>madness.  He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.  How I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>observer.  The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mourner.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.  For</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever.  And I call on you,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.\"  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my utterance.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>determined to live, and I am satisfied.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eluded my grasp.  Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>mortal speed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>country chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>sleep alone that I could taste joy.  O blessed sleep!  Often, when most</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>health and youth.  Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fondness did I feel for them!  How did I cling to their dear forms, as</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>they still lived!  At such moments vengeance, that burned within me,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stone that guided me and instigated my fury.  \"My reign is not yet</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>over\"—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—\"you</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>live, and my power is complete.  Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>which I am impassive.  You will find near this place, if you follow not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>must you endure until that period shall arrive.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>miserable fiend, to torture and death.  Never will I give up my search</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>their hiding-places to seek for prey.  The rivers were covered with</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the difficulty of my labours.  One inscription that he left was in</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>these words:  \"Prepare!  Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>rapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not weep, but I knelt down</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.  With new</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hamlet on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>fiend and gained accurate information.  A gigantic monster, they said,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winter</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.  Yet at the idea</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>departed from land.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.  Immense and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>form within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>oppressed me, I wept aloud.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>irksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was still visible, nor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.  I indeed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>had ever done before.  A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>moment more ominous and terrific.  I pressed on, but in vain.  The wind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>came so far north and was astounded at the sight.  I quickly destroyed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>enemy.  But your direction was northwards.  You took me on board when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and satisfy my vengeance in his death.  And do I dare to ask of you to</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquent</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>trust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>thrust your sword into his heart.  I will hover near and direct the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>steel aright.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>               Walton, in continuation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>difficulty the words so replete with anguish.  His fine and lovely eyes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and quenched in infinite wretchedness.  Sometimes he commanded his</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>his asseverations, however earnest and connected.  Such a monster has,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>then, really existence!  I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the world a demoniacal enemy?  Peace, peace!  Learn my miseries and do</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.  I wish to soothe</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.  His</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>without tears.  What a glorious creature must he have been in the days</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!  He seems</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"When younger,\" said he, \"I believed myself destined for some great</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.  This sentiment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.  When I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dust.  All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.

From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.\"  Must I then lose this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?  Can any</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.  They know our</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.  But</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September 2nd</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My beloved Sister,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>none to bestow.

I hesitated before I answered, when</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.  Turning towards the men,</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he said, \"What do you mean?  What do you demand of your captain?  Are</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"And wherefore was it glorious?

When</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>stay.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>uncontrollable passion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Oh, Frankenstein!

He is cold, he cannot answer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>me.\" His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>compassion.  I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>self-reproaches.  At length I gathered resolution to address him in a</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>dead to agony and remorse?

I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>disobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>despair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had no</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.  \"Wretch!\" I said.  \"It</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>made.
