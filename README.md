# Spark Essentials
This repository contains a guide to Apache Spark, covering various topics from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## Overview
- [Introduction](01%20Introduction.md): 
  - This section introduces Apache Spark, discussing its advantages over traditional systems like MapReduce, its history, and key features. 
  - It explains Spark's architecture, detailing high-level libraries, Spark Core, and cluster managers, along with the driver and worker components. Core concepts like SparkSession, dataflow, cluster management, and execution are covered, concluding with Kubernetes integration.

- [Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)](02%20RDD.md): 
  - Defines RDDs, highlighting their characteristics and the difference between transformations and actions. 
  - It outlines key features, various operations (creation, transformation, action), and provides examples, including word count and join operations. Execution methods for Spark applications are also discussed.

- [Spark SQL](03%20Spark%20SQL.md): 
  - Spark SQL is introduced with its features, component stack, and Hive integration. 
  - It covers DataFrames and Datasets, their creation, evolution, and usage in PySpark and Scala. 
  - The section explains SQL context, SparkSession, user-defined functions, query optimization, data partitioning, skew, caching, and Spark 3 improvements.

- [Spark Streaming](04%20Spark%20Streaming.md): 
  - This section highlights the importance of real-time processing, describing DStreams, their sources, and the integration with batch code. 
  - It compares DStreams with structured streaming, covering windowing, watermarking, output modes, stream processing, triggers, continuous processing, and fault tolerance. 
  - Kafka connectors and their usage are also discussed.

- [Delta Lake](05%20Delta%20Lake.md): 
  - Delta Lake addresses common data lake challenges with features like transaction logs, ACID transactions, and conflict resolution. 
  - It covers advanced functionalities like time travel, schema enforcement, upsert operations, and constraints. 
  - Change Data Feed, optimization techniques, integrations with other platforms, future developments, and the lakehouse concept are also explored.
